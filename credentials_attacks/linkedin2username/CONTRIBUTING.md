# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you so much for thinking about contributing!

There are a few ways you can help, if you're so inclined:
- Open up an issue on here if you notice something odd.
- Submit a feature request if you think the tool should be doing something additional.
- Submit bug fixes or streamlime the existing code.

I'd like to keep the tool pretty straightforward, so that it does one thing and does it well.

Before you spend a lot of time re-writing something massive, it might be worth contacting me first just to make sure I'm not in the middle of a conflicting re-write. You can open an issue or try me at protonmail.

Thanks for reading!
